          The passion and values instilled in the Old Boys has driven them to
          rebuild their Alma Mater to create a 21st century school to develop
          21st century skills. I am both humbled and proud to be part of such an
          ambitious and life changing project.

          If these values resonate with you, then GCU is the institution for
          you. The core focus of GCU will be the pursuit of excellence. This
          will cut across academics, sport, social skills, as well as developing
          good morals and values in the young men of GCU. Our aim is that all
          students achieve beyond their potential and become lifelong learners,
          able to take their place as Global Citizens in International
          Communities around the world.
